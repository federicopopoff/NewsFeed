            <h3>About</h3>
            RSSReader lets you keep up with your favourite websites and news feeds from inside your browser and access them anytime you're on the web.
            RSSReader was written over a weekend as part of an coding test. It is built on the ASP.NET MVC Framework using C#, jQuery and MSSQL.

            <h3>Features</h3>
            RSSReader has a host of useful features. Including:
            <ul>
                <li>Subscribe to feeds</li>
                <li>Unsubscribe from feeds</li>
                <li>Read feeds</li>
                <li>That's it</li>

        <div class="span-8 last">
            <h3>Pricing</h3>
            RSSReader is 100% free. Obviously we'll plaster annoying Flash ads all over it once we get the traffic, but for now you're safe.
